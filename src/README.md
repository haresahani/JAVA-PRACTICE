Pattern cheat-sheet (clues → mental tool)

# “Find pair / two numbers equal target” → Hash map (counts) or two-pointer (if sorted).

# “Longest / shortest subarray with condition” → Sliding window / two pointers.

# “Prefix sums, many queries about subarray sums” → Prefix sums / cumulative array.

# “Questions about counts/frequencies / anagrams” → Hash map of frequencies.

# “Sorted + locate boundary / count ≤ X” → Binary search on index or value.

# “All permutations / generate combinations” → Backtracking (recursion) with choices.

# “Shortest path unweighted” → BFS.

# “Reachability, cycles on directed graph” → DFS + backtracking / topological sort.

# “Choose k-th largest / median” → Heaps or quickselect idea.

# “Optimizing choices with overlapping subproblems” → Dynamic programming (memoize).

# “Constraints small (n ≤ 20) and subsets” → Bitmask / subset enumeration.

# “Need best/worst across intervals with sliding behavior” → Monotonic queue / deque.
